## üöÄ How to Run This Project

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.6+
* A Google Gemini API Key

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    Save the `app.py` file to a new, empty folder on your computer.

2.  **Create an `uploads` Folder:**
    In the same directory as `app.py`, create an empty folder named `uploads`. This is required for the calendar attachment feature.
    ```bash
    mkdir uploads
    ```

3.  **Create an `assets` Folder:**
    In the same directory, create an `assets` folder and place your screenshots inside it.
    ```bash
    mkdir assets
    ```

4.  **Create a `.env` File:**
    In the same folder, create a new file named `.env`. Open it and add the following line, replacing the placeholder with your actual Gemini API key:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

5.  **Create a `.gitignore` File:**
    Create a file named `.gitignore` in the same folder and add the content provided in the section above. This is critical for protecting secrets and user data.

6.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    # On macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # On Windows
    python -m venv venv
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

7.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Run the following command to install all required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install Flask python-dotenv werkzeug pandas openpyxl odfpy fpdf2 requests
    ```

8.  **Run for First-Time Setup:**
    The very first time you run the script, it will prompt you in the terminal to create the Super Admin account.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    After successfully creating the admin user, the script will exit.

9.  **Run for Normal Use:**
    Run the script again to start the web server.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

10. **Access the Application:**
    * **Student View:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
    * **Staff Login:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000/login`
